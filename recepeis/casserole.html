    When summer squash season rolls around and you need a way to use up your
    yellow squash bounty, what better dish to make than a creamy, cheesy, and
    buttery squash casserole? The Southern classic combines fresh squash and
    onion with a creamy sauce and a crunchy cracker-Cheddar cheese topping.
    Whether you serve this squash casserole as a flavorful side or a
    veggie-centric main dish, everyone will be begging you to make it again
    and again for family gatherings, potlucks, and holidays.
