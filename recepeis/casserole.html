  <h2>How to Make Squash Casserole</h2>
  <p>
    A good squash casserole starts with good, fresh ingredients. Try to look
    for yellow squash that is on the smaller side because they have fewer
    seeds and taste sweeter. While this recipe simply calls for an onion,
    Southerners know that using a sweet onion will take your casserole to the
    next level. However, you can use a yellow onion if that's all you have.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, you need to cook the squash and onion in a large skillet with water
    over medium heat until the vegetables are tender. This step is extremely
    important to remove the excess liquid from the squash so you don't end up
    with a watery casserole. After the vegetables are tender, drain them well
    and set aside.
