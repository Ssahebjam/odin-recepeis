  <h2>How to Make Squash Casserole</h2>
  <p>
    A good squash casserole starts with good, fresh ingredients. Try to look
    for yellow squash that is on the smaller side because they have fewer
    seeds and taste sweeter. While this recipe simply calls for an onion,
    Southerners know that using a sweet onion will take your casserole to the
    next level. However, you can use a yellow onion if that's all you have.
