  <h2>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
    You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super
    simple pizza crust.
  </p>
  <h3>Yeast</h3>
  <p>
    Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient
    that causes the pizza dough to rise.
  </p>
  <h3>Sugar</h3>
  <p>
    To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a
    teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds
    up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it
    becomes bubbly and frothy on top.
